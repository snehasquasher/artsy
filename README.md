Instructions of Use
Hello everyone! Welcome to Skribbl! Skribbl is a Kinect-based drawing application designed for the everyday pedestrian on Yale's campus. It is used as an outlet for releasing stress, by making easy sketches with various prompts describing a variety of emotions one might experience. We are hoping for this to be a cathartic experience in which one is able to release stress and connect with the Yale community by viewing your friendâ€™s emotional release sketches.  

By creating a community doodle board, the app also facilitates a sense of connection and community among students, which is essential for their overall well-being. With the rising stress levels and mental health concerns among students, this app provides a platform for them to take care of their mental health fun and engagingly. By providing a solution to the problem of stress and isolation, this app has the potential to positively impact students' lives.

How to Use

The default landing screen is our home screen which displays a dynamic gallery of various sketches from the students at Yale. If you wish to view paintings made by other users, feel free to stand there and take your time! No rush! However, do be mindful of other people wanting to use the application. If you wish to participate in drawing a sketch with Sketch Pad, raise your arm above your head for 5 seconds. Viola! You've taken the first step towards becoming a Sketch Pad artist. 

Now the screen will present two options to you - you can use either 'Free Draw,' meaning draw anything on your own will, or you can pick a prompt to give you a motivating source for your drawing. If you select a prompt, you may continue with the prompt the application generates or develop a new random prompt to your liking. Once you have decided whether to 'Free Draw' or pick a prompt - here is where the exciting part comes in - the actual drawing! We have also selected the randomly generated prompts to correspond to emotion words like happy, sad, angry etc, hoping for this to be a good way for users to sketch different emotions and relieve stress. 

Your right hand will basically act as a cursor for your paintbrush/sketching tool. Once you have drawn to your heart's content, you may submit the drawing by raising your left hand. Once you have submitted your picture, you can scan a QR code and obtain your image. Furthermore, you may proceed from the QR prompt to the next screen, which will ask for your permission to display your drawing on the home display, which rotates weekly!

Enjoy!!!
